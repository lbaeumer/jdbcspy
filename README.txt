A lightweight monitoring and profiling jdbc driver proxy

The jdbcspy is a lightweight profiling and monitoring proxy for your jdbc connection. It can be configured very easily and will provide information, which statements are executed, what are the statements with the longest duration, additional statistics about your connections, what statements are executed how often, etc. In addition it is possible to extend the proxy by implementing custom listeners that will provide additional information.
